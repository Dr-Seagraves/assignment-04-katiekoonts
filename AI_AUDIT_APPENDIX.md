# AI Audit Appendix (Assignment 04)

## Tool(s) Used
-GitHub Copilot

## Task(s) Where AI Was Used
- To retrieve results
- To visualize the data in the form of a scatterplot 

## Prompt(s)(I don't know all of the prompts I used because I started this 2 days ago and the copilot reset)
- "Help me visualize REIT annual return vs. dividend yeild"
- "Help me visualize REIT annual return vs. FFO to assets"
- "Help me visualize annual return vs. Prime loan rate"

## Output Summary
- GitHub Copilot provided clear explanations of the assignment structure (three regressions: ret ~ div12m_me, ret ~ prime_rate, ret ~ ffo_at_reit)
- Confirmed that all regression results had been estimated and saved to `Results/regression_*.txt` files
- Verified that scatter plots with fitted regression lines had been created
- Offered assistance in extracting regression values and filling in the report template

## Verification & Modifications (Disclose • Verify • Critique)
- **Verify:** How you checked the output (e.g., ran the script, spot-checked regression table)
- **Critique:** What was wrong/incomplete and why
- **Modify:** What you changed in your final work

## If No AI Tools Used
Write: "No AI tools were used for this assignment."
